# A public repo for the my Fall 2017 IS452 lecture notes

## Status

This is now complete and will no longer be added to.  This repo will now be the basis for the Spring 2018 semester.

## About

This is the repo for the IS452 A/AO class materials that I can make public, but mainly for the notebooks containing my lecure notes and occasionaly slides.  The spring 2017 repo can be found [here](https://github.com/elliewix/LIS452-Spring2017Lectures).  

I will add the completed (or in progress toward being completed) notebooks as links in the schedule.  For my own reference I've added a folder with the spring notebooks.

Jupyter notebooks should render nicely inside of github, but you'll need to download and open any powerpoint slides.
